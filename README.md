# MouseWover
Ramdomly moves your mouse in a 500x500 area.<br>
Useful when you're in homeoffice and don't want your status to change to AFK even though you are AFK.

# Usage
Just click on `core.exe`, then click on `download`. Once you downloaded it, simply run the file. <br>
When you want to stop the program, move the mouse a lot until the program recognizes it and stops.<br>
<br>
The .exe was created with [pyinstaller](https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller). If you wonder what exactly the .exe does, have a look at core.py
